Hello,

Thanks for a great first week! I made a significant change to the calendar moving the "Data" week later in the term to where it will be more relevant and bumping up the rest of the Wekinator material since we are already cracked open that egg. Those changes are reflected as of this message. 

Also, the recorded class sessions are making thier way online. Long story short they are huge files and take forever to encode/upload/etc... I appreciate your patience if you've been waiting for them to be available. Those will be linked in the D2L "Announcements" section on the course home page and next to the "Session" info in the course calendar.

If you haven't downloaded the "What is AI?" pdf you might want to scan through that before next week. It will help put a lot of what we are talking about in context. (Readings tab)
 

Right on,
Staysh
