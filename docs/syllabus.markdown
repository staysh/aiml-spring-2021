### Course Description
Covers theories and frameworks related to computational or
artificial creativity and approaches to endowing machines
with creative behaviors. Involves examination of artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in connection
with a comprehensive range of arts and creative enterprises
such as musical composition and interpretation, sound
design, video game creation, drawing, painting, image
generation, writing, storytelling, poetry, and design-
related tasks. Prerequisites: WR 115, RD 115 and MTH 20 or
equivalent placement test scores. Recommended: MUC 272.
Audit available.

### Course Outcomes
Upon completion of the course students should be able to:

* Define artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
and key vocabularies of AI/ML to understand and engage in public
and academic discourse.
* Recount the technological and social histories of AI/ML,
including the technological lineages and surrounding narratives.
* Define computational creativity (artificial creativity or meta-
creation) and illustrate its historical and contemporary roles
with real-world examples in multiple arts (sonic arts, visual
arts, literary arts) and from artists of diverse cultural and
national identities.
* Demonstrate competence with historical and contemporary AI and
ML creative applications, technologies, softwares and/or tool-
chains.
