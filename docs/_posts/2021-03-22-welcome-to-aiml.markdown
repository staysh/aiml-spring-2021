Hello and welcome to AI and ML for the Arts at PCC. This course page was made to be a simple place to
bookmark and refer to throughout the course without having to log in to D2L just to check the calendar
or the syllabus or look up a link. Any changes will be noted here in the posts as well as interesting links
and relevant articles. The [calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar/) page has a weekly breakdown of topics and session content.
[Syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/) has the course syllabus. [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) has links to other open course curriculum 
that is available online. [Materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/) has installation guides for all the software we will be using 
this term. Please take a look around, bookmark the site, and subscribe to the RSS feed if you mess with RSS. 

Right on,
Staysh
